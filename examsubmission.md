# Submit your code

These are some instructions to submit your exercises, assuming you don't know how to use git. But if you're a git pro just go ahead and use your terminal! 

1. Go to [github.com](www.github.com) and create an account there (if you don't have one already). Pick a professional username please.
2. Hit the + button, then *New repository*.
3. Call your new repository `machinelearning4physics_bicocca_2026_solutions` and set it to **PRIVATE**
4. Click on *Upload existing files*
5. On the next page, upload your exercises and then click the green button *Commit changes*.
6. Then go to *Settings*, then *Collaborators* and then *Add people*
7. Here add users **dgerosa** (Davide Gerosa) and **UPDATE** (UPDATE). Careful: select the right people!
8. When you're done, send us an email to say your codes are ready to be marked.
